        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around
            to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The
            farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
            evening
            everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
            horses!”
            The farmer again said, “Maybe.” </p>

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too
            <tag class="bad"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad" title="bad is according to wikipedia..."

            ,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.” The next day the
            conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he
            had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said,
            “Maybe.”
